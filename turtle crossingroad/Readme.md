# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A fun Python game built with the **turtle graphics module** where your turtle tries to cross a busy road full of cars 🚗🚙💨. Each successful crossing earns you a point — but one crash, and it’s game over!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the game script.
2. Use the **↑ Up Arrow key** to move your turtle forward.
3. Dodge the cars as they zoom by.
4. Reach the other side safely → your score increases ✅.
5. Keep going as long as you can… but watch out for crashes ❌.
