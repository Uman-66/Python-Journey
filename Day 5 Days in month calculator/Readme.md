# 📆 Leap Year Month Days Calculator

A simple Python program that determines the number of days in a given month and year — considering whether it’s a leap year or not.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Takes `year` and `month` input from the user.
2. Determines if the year is a **leap year** using correct leap year logic:
   - Divisible by 4 ✅
   - Not divisible by 100 ❌ (unless divisible by 400 ✅)
3. Returns the number of days in that month accordingly.

## ✨ Sample Input/Output


## 💡 Key Concepts

- Conditional logic (`if-else`)
- Lists for days in months
- Function modularity
- Leap year calculation

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Understanding how to implement leap year logic is a classic coding exercise — great for learning conditionals and handling real-world rules in code.
