# 📏 Day 3 – Average Height Calculator

This Python program takes space-separated student heights as input and calculates:

- ✅ Total height
- ✅ Number of students (using a manual loop)
- ✅ The average height (rounded)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Input handling with `.split()`
- Type conversion (`str` → `int`)
- `for` loops and list traversal
- Manual counting (no use of `len()`)
- `round()` function for averages

---

## 📦 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
