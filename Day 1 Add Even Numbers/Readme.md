# âœ¨ Day 1 â€“ Add All Even Numbers

This Python script adds all even numbers from 0 up to a user-defined limit using a step-wise `for` loop.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does
- Takes a single number input from the user
- Iterates from 0 to that number (inclusive)
- Adds only the **even numbers**
- Prints the final total

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced
- Using `range(start, stop, step)`
- Looping through even numbers directly
- Incremental addition with `+=`
- Input handling and basic integer operations

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
