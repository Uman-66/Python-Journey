# 🔢 Day 2 – Max Number Finder

This simple Python script takes space-separated numbers from the user and finds the **maximum number** using basic logic and loops.

---

## 🎯 What It Does
- Accepts a list of numbers as space-separated input
- Converts the input strings to integers
- Iterates through each number to find the largest one
- Prints out the maximum value

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- User input and `.split()`
- Type conversion (`str` → `int`)
- Index-based `for` loop
- Manual maximum finder logic (no use of built-in `max()`)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
