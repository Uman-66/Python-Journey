# ðŸ§  Basic Python Practice

This folder contains the foundational Python scripts I wrote during my early learning journey.  
Each file or folder is from a specific day's practice â€” solving simple problems and exploring concepts like conditionals, loops, lists, and functions.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Folder Exists

These scripts are not advanced projects. They're here to:

- Show my **daily learning progress**
- Demonstrate understanding of Python basics
- Serve as a **reference point** as I improve

> ðŸ§  This isn't a "portfolio" â€” it's a *playground of learning*.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
Larger or polished projects (e.g., Snake Game, Coffee Machine) will be stored in their own dedicated folders inside the main repo.
